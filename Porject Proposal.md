### Project 5 Proposal

#### Analysis Objective:
In this analysis I'm trying to build a content based perfume recommendation engine for [Fragrancex]('https://www.fragrancex.com/'), a website which sells fragrances. This recommendation engine will be built based on topic modelings.

#### Data Description:
The data are scrapped from [Fragrancex]('https://www.fragrancex.com/'). I start to scrape data of women's perfume section, and depends on the time, I may include data from men's cologne section. (And the final recommendation engine will be adjusted based on the data I have.)

The feature that will be used for modeling are the product descriptions of each perfume item.

#### Tools:
* Python3

#### MVP Goal:
* NLP pipeline with text preprocessing and a document-term matrix. And a basic topic modeling.
